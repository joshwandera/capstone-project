# Personal Expense and Budget Tracker - Pseudocode

This pseudocode follows the structure of `main.py`. It also applies to
`gui_main.py`, because the GUI reuses the same functions. The sections are
split by function so they line up with the main parts of the project brief.

---

## 1. LOAD_TRANSACTIONS

```text
FUNCTION load_transactions():
    OPEN 'cap-data.csv' for reading
    READ header row to get field names
    CREATE empty list: data

    FOR EACH row in the CSV:
        CONVERT row["amount_kes"] to a float
        CONVERT row["budget_limit_kes"] to a float
        FOR EACH text field in row:
            STRIP leading/trailing whitespace
        APPEND row to data

    RETURN data
END FUNCTION
```

---

## 2. VALIDATE_TRANSACTION (single record)

```text
FUNCTION validate_transaction(record):
    CREATE empty list: reasons

    // Rule: type must be Income or Expense
    type <- record["transaction_type"], stripped
    IF type is NOT "Income" AND type is NOT "Expense":
        ADD "unrecognized transaction_type" to reasons

    // Rule: amount must be numeric and > 0
    TRY:
        amount <- CONVERT record["amount_kes"] to float
        IF amount <= 0:
            ADD "amount must be greater than zero" to reasons
    CATCH conversion error:
        ADD "amount must be numeric" to reasons

    // Rule: category required for Expense
    category <- record["category"], stripped
    IF type is "Expense" AND category is empty:
        ADD "missing category for expense" to reasons

    // Rule: budget limit must not be negative
    TRY:
        budget <- CONVERT record["budget_limit_kes"] to float
        IF budget < 0:
            ADD "negative budget limit" to reasons
    CATCH conversion error:
        ADD "budget_limit_kes must be numeric" to reasons

    RETURN reasons   // empty list means the record is valid
END FUNCTION
```

    WRITE header row
    WRITE every record in transactions as a CSV row
END FUNCTION
```

## 6. SEARCH_TRANSACTION

```text
FUNCTION search_transaction(valid_records):
    PROMPT "Search by Transaction ID or Category"
    term <- input, lowercased, stripped

## 10. CHECK_CATEGORY_BUDGET_SUMMARY

    FOR EACH record in valid_records:
        IF record type is "Expense":
            ADD amount to category_totals[category]
            ADD budget_limit to category_budgets[category]

    CREATE empty list: summary

    (valid_records, invalid_records) <- validate_all(transactions)

    LOOP FOREVER:
        DISPLAY menu:
            1. View valid transactions

                 // re-validate, since add_transaction may have changed the data
                 (valid_records, invalid_records) <- validate_all(transactions)

## Notes

- The **calculation** functions (`calculate_summary`, `highest_spending_category`,
    `check_individual_budget_warnings`, `check_category_budget_summary`,
    `calculate_payment_method_totals`) only return data. They do not print or ask
    for input. This lets the CLI and GUI share the same logic, and it also makes
    the functions easier to test on their own.
- The **display** functions (`display_table`, `display_summary`,
    `display_all_budget_warnings`, `display_payment_summary`,
    `display_invalid_table`) handle the printing and formatting. They call the
    calculation functions instead of doing the calculations again.
- `validate_transaction()` handles the four validation rules. It is called when
    the CSV is loaded and when a new transaction is added, so both paths use the
    same checks.
- Transaction types are not guessed or normalized. The program accepts `Income`
    and `Expense`; other values stay unchanged and are rejected by
    `validate_transaction()` as unrecognized.
